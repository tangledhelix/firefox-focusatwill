focusatwill-hotkey binds a hotkey to play/pause in your focus@will tab.  If
the site is not already open, it will launch a new tab for you.

See the add-on preferences to set the hotkey.  You can also control whether
the site is launched if not already open, and whether to pin the tab if it
is launched.
